# Healthcare Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing a healthcare dataset sourced from Kaggle. Python and Google Colab were used for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), while Power BI was utilized for data visualization. The project aims to ensure high data quality and deliver meaningful insights through clear and effective visualizations.

## Data sourced

This dataset consists of 10,000 records, each representing a synthetic patient healthcare record. It includes various attributes such as patient demographics, medical conditions, and admission details. The dataset is intended for educational and non-commercial use and is entirely synthetic, containing no real patient information.

## Tool Used

- **Python (via Google Colab)** – Used for data cleaning, processing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Google Colab** – Development environment for Python notebooks. 
- **Power BI** – Used to create interactive dand insightful data visualizations

## How to run / view project

1. Download the raw dataset from the data/raw/ folder in the project repository.
2. Download the Colab notebook (.ipynb) from the notebooks/ folder.
3. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
4. Ensure all required Python libraries (listed in the notebook, e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib) are installed.
5. Run the code cells sequentially to clean, process, and analyze the data. The cleaned dataset will be saved in data/cleaned/.
6. Explore the visualizations in Power BI using the processed dataset provided.
