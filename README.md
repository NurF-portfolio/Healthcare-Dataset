# Healthcare Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing a healthcare dataset sourced from Kaggle. Python and Google Colab were used for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), while Power BI was utilized for data visualization. The project aims to ensure high data quality and deliver meaningful insights through clear and effective visualizations.

## Data sourced

This dataset consists of 10,000 records, each representing a synthetic patient healthcare record. It includes various attributes such as patient demographics, medical conditions, and admission details. The dataset is intended for educational and non-commercial use and is entirely synthetic, containing no real patient information.

## Tool Used

- **Python (via Google Colab)** – Used for data cleaning, processing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Google Colab** – Development environment for Python notebooks. 
- **Power BI** – Used to create interactive dand insightful data visualizations
